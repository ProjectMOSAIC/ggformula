[`gf_dotplot()`](gf_dotplot.md) with interactive features like tooltips
and clickable elements.

## Arguments

  A formula specifying a variable for tooltips, or a character vector.

- data_id:

  A formula or character vector specifying data identifiers for
  interactive selection.

- alpha, color, size, shape, fill, group, stroke:

  Aesthetics passed to the geom.

- xlab, ylab, title, subtitle, caption:

  Labels for the plot.

- show.legend:

  Logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?

- show.help:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, display some minimal help.

- inherit:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, inherit aesthetics from previous layers.

- environment:

  An environment in which to evaluate the formula.

## Value

A gg object that can be displayed with [`gf_girafe()`](gf_girafe.md).
